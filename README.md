# BeMyHand

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Our application empowers a certain class of physically challenged people by providing them a voice and eye-gaze controllable platform. This platform enables them to develop skills in the field of writing by providing them a voice-controlled text editor. They’ll also be needing to publish their articles to showcase their writing skills that they can easily do by publishing their articles in our articles directory. They can easily access, edit, update, and delete any of their written documents from this article directory. Our app also enables them to build a very crucial document of a person’s professional career, a CV. With our fully-fledged voice-controlled CV Builder, the users can build an amazing CV. On top of these ground pillars, our app allows the users to develop their portfolio website and host it with us. Eye-gaze detection will be used for top level navigation within the app. In this way, our app will provide a complete toolkit for our users to boost their professional careers by developing skills and building a professional presence online.

Briefly described, our app provides the following four voice and eye-gazed controllable tools for our users that are a complete toolset for them to build a professional stance:
1. Portfolio Web Page
2. CV Builder
3. Text Editor
4. Article Directory

We are contributing to the problem of accessibility for these people. Our app will introduce a new platform for them, through which they can gain insights into the IT field and also build a strong professional stance


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
